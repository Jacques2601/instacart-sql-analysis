-- This SQL query analyzes customer distribution by country, focusing specifically on
-- how many of the top 5 highest-paying customers live in each country.
-- It filters through customer demographics in top cities and countries
-- to determine which regions contain the most valuable customers.

-- Step 1: Identify the top 10 countries with the most customers.
