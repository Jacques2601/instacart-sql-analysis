-- This SQL query identifies the top 5 highest-paying customers based on total payment amount.
-- The analysis is limited to customers who live in the top 10 cities, 
-- which are themselves located in the top 10 countries based on customer volume.

-- Step 1: Select the top 10 countries with the highest number of customers.
WITH top_countries AS (
    SELECT D.country
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    GROUP BY D.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

-- Step 2: From those top countries, select the top 10 cities by customer count.
top_cities AS (
    SELECT C.city
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE D.country IN (SELECT country FROM top_countries)
    GROUP BY C.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

-- Final Step: Identify the top 5 customers (by total payment) who live in the top 10 cities.
