-- This SQL query calculates the **average total payment** made by the top 5 highest-paying customers 
-- who are located in the top 10 most populous cities, within the top 10 countries by customer count.

-- Step 1: Identify the top 10 countries based on number of customers.
WITH top_ten_countries AS (
    SELECT cnt1.country
    FROM customer AS cust1
    INNER JOIN address AS addr1 ON cust1.address_id = addr1.address_id

    INNER JOIN country AS cnt1 ON cty1.country_id = cnt1.country_id
    GROUP BY cnt1.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(cust1.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

-- Step 2: Within those top 10 countries, find the top 10 cities also based on customer count.
top_ten_cities AS (

    GROUP BY cty2.city

),

-- Step 3: From those top cities, select the top 5 customers based on total amount paid.

    INNER JOIN top_ten_cities ON top_ten_cities.city = cty3.city

-- Final Step: Calculate the average payment among those top 5 customers.
